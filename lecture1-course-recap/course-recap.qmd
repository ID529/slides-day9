## moral

"I will let the data speak for itself when it cleans itself." <br>
—Allison Reichel

<br><br>

:::{.fragment}
You should be incredibly proud of yourselves not just for getting to the
finish line of ID529, but for all the work, the trial and error, the questions
and the fantastic attitudes you've shared with all of us. <br>

## tidy workflows

## data analysis work can't be just modeling

<img src="images/modeling.jpg" alt="remember, we can't just focus on modeling">

## practice

<img src="images/jarvis_practice.jpg" alt="every aspect of our analysis workflows will benefit from practice">

## use R projects and packages to stay organized

  - have a roadmap of what you're aiming to accomplish
  - have a changelog or timeline or anthology of
  decisions made on your project

## use git to avoid {.xsmall}

  - going on archaeological digs on old email threads
  - uncertainty about which version of the code is the most
  up-to-date
  - uncertainty on what's the most recent data 
  - uncertainty on if issues have been solved
  - zip files of file salad

## make your work more pleasant {.xsmall}

using modern tooling in R and on GitHub 

  - you can have joyful code instead of dreadful code
  - you can feel confident about your code instead of leery and uncertain
  - your projects can be colorful and expressive, not bland and
  joyless

## making your work navigable for others

sharing your work through markdown files on GitHub is great, but you can also 

  - blog about your work 
  - tweet / post about it on social media
  - and make interactive web pages to play with the data / findings


## get help from the community

## reduce tedium and manual processes

  - sometimes tedium is necessary; however:
  - often solutions already exist to do what you're trying to do! 
  - or you can be clever about restructuring what you need to do 
  to leverage tooling that already exists

## make collaboration easier {.xsmall}

  - use git & github 
  - use clean & considerate code 
  - make your work **easily** reproducible

## make communciation easier {.xsmall}

  - no one has every said "it's a shame we have all this great documentation"
  - reproducible examples will make getting help on your challenges `Inf`% easier
  - use R Markdown and literate programming practices to make your analysis
  transparent and engaging for your colleagues and collaborators.
  - a fantastic ggplot can do more than speak 1000 words: it can tell a good
  story with a coherent narrative and resultantly capture and intrigue viewers.
